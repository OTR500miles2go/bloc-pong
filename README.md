## Bloc-Pong

This project is strictly about creating fun.

Pong is one of the earliest computer games ever created. It simulates a table-tennis or ping-pong match. A player earns a point when the ball gets past the opponent's paddle. The first player to earn eleven points wins.

In a throwback to 1972, this project is used to test basic JavaScript skills by recreating this arcade classic.
